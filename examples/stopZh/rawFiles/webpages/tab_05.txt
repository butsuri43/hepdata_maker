Background fit results for the FNP validation regions.
The `Others' category is dominated by tt&#772; W production and also contains the contributions from tt&#772; h, tt&#772; WW, tt&#772; t, tt&#772; tt&#772;, Wh, and Zh production.
Combined statistical and systematic uncertainties are given.
Some of the uncertainties are correlated and therefore the overall sum in quadrature does not necessarily add to the total systematic uncertainty.
The number of tanti-{t}Z and multi-boson background events is estimated as described in Section~ref{sec:BkgPrompt}.
