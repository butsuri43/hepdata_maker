Comparison of the observed and expected event yields in the different kinematic regions used to validate the tt&#772; background estimation in the 1&#8467; selection.
The `Higgs' category contains the contributions from gluon--gluon fusion, vector-boson fusion, Wh, Zh and tt&#772; h production.
The `Others' category contains the contributions from tt&#772; WW, tt&#772; WZ, tt&#772; t and tt&#772; tt&#772; production.
The lower panel shows the ratio of the observed data to the total SM background prediction, with bands representing the total uncertainty in the background prediction.
