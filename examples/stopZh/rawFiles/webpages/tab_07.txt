Background fit results for the control and validation regions for the tt&#772; Z and multi-boson backgrounds. The pre-fit predictions from MC simulation are given for comparison for those backgrounds (tanti-{t}Z, multi-boson) that are normalised to data.
The `Others' category contains the contributions from tt&#772; h, tt&#772; W, tt&#772; WW, tt&#772; t, tt&#772; tt&#772;, Wh, and Zh production.
Combined statistical and systematic uncertainties are given.
Some of the uncertainties are correlated and therefore the overall sum in quadrature does not necessarily add to the total systematic uncertainty.
The number of events with fake/non-prompt leptons is estimated with the data-driven technique described in Section~ref{sec:bkgF}.
