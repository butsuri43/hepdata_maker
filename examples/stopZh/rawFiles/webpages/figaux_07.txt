Distribution in CR<sup>h</sup><sub>tt&#772;</sub> of the score of the neural network used for the identification of Higgs boson candidates decaying into b-quarks.
The tt&#772; background process is normalised via the simultaneous fit described in Section~ref{sec:bkg}.
The contributions from all SM backgrounds are shown as a histogram stack; the bands represent the total uncertainty in the background prediction.
The `Higgs' category contains the contributions from gluon--gluon fusion, vector-boson fusion, Wh, Zh and tt&#772; h production.
The `Others' category contains the contributions from tt&#772; WW, tt&#772; WZ, tt&#772; t and tt&#772; tt&#772; production.
The last bin contains the overflow.
The lower panel shows the ratio of the observed data to the total SM background prediction, with bands representing the total uncertainty in the background prediction.
