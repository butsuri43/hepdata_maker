Exclusion limits at 95 CL on the masses of the t&#771;<sub>2</sub> and &chi;&#771;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;,
for a fixed m(t&#771;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)-m(&chi;&#771;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) = 40~GeV and assuming {cal B}(t&#771;<sub>2</sub> &rarr; Zt&#771;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1.
The dashed line and the shaded band are the expected limit and its &plusmn;1 &sigma; uncertainty, respectively. The thick solid line is the observed limit for the central value of the signal cross-section.
The expected and observed limits do not include the effect of the theoretical uncertainties in the signal cross-section. The dotted lines show the effect on the observed limit of varying the signal cross-section by &plusmn; 1 &sigma; of the theoretical uncertainty.
