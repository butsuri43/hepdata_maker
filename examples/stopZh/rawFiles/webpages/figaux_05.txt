Number of b-tagged jets distribution in VR<sub>VV</sub><sup>Z,b-tag</sup>.
The contributions from all SM backgrounds are shown after the background fit described in Section~ref{sec:bkg}; the hashed bands represent the total uncertainty.
The `Others' category contains the contributions from tt&#772; h, tt&#772; W, tt&#772; WW, tt&#772; t, tt&#772; tt&#772;, Wh, and Zh production.
The `FNP' category represents the background from fake or non-prompt leptons.
The last bin in each figure contains the overflow.
The lower panels show the ratio of the observed data to the total SM background prediction, with the bands representing the total uncertainty in the background prediction.
