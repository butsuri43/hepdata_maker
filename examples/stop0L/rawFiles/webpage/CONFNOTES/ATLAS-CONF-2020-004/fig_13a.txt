Observed (red solid line) and expected (black dashed line) exclusion contours at 95% CL as (a) a function of the &chi;&#771;<sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup> vs. t&#771; masses and (b) &Delta; m(t&#771;,&chi;&#771;<sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>) vs. t&#771; mass. Masses that are within the contours are excluded. Uncertainty bands corresponding to the &plusmn; 1 &sigma; variation of the expected limit (yellow band) and the sensitivity of the observed limit to &plusmn; 1&sigma; variations of the signal total cross section (red dotted lines) are also indicated. Observed limits from previous ATLAS searches [22,23,24,25,27,28] based on 36.1 fb<sup>-1</sup> of pp collision data are provided for comparison in grey.
