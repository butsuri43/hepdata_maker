Distributions illustrating the agreement between data (points) and the SM expectation (stacked histograms, after simultaneously fitting to all backgrounds) in the tt&#772;+Z  control region: (a) &Sscr; and (b) p<sub>T</sub>(&#8467;,&#8467;) for CRTTZ. The hatched uncertainty band around the SM expectation includes the combination of MC statistical, theory-related and detector-related systematic uncertainties. The rightmost bin in each plot includes all overflows.
