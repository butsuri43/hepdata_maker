Distributions illustrating the agreement between data (points) and the SM expectation (stacked histograms, after simultaneously fitting to all backgrounds) in several validation regions: (a) m<sub>2</sub><sup>R=1.2</sup> in VRZA, (b) m<sub>T</sub><sup>b,min</sup> in VRZB-TTTW, (c) p<sub>T</sub><sup>ISR</sup> in VRTC, and (d) E<sub>T</sub><sup>miss</sup>/&radic;H<sub>T</sub> in VRZD1. The hatched uncertainty band around the SM expectation includes the combination of MC statistical, theory-related and detector-related systematic uncertainties. The rightmost bin in each plot includes all overflows.
