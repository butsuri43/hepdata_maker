Distributions of (a) &Sscr; in SRA-TW, (b) m<sub>1</sub><sup>R=1.2</sup> in SRB-TT, (c) R<sub>ISR</sub> in SRC, and (d--f) E<sub>T</sub><sup>miss</sup>/&radic;H<sub>T</sub>  in SRD0--2 after the SRA--B, SRC and SRD background-only likelihood fits. The stacked histograms show the SM prediction and the hatched uncertainty band around the SM prediction shows the total uncertainty, which includes the MC statistical uncertainties, detector-related systematic uncertainties, and theoretical uncertainties. The data (points) are overlaid. For each variable, the distribution for a representative signal point is overlaid as a dashed line. The rightmost bin includes overflow events.
