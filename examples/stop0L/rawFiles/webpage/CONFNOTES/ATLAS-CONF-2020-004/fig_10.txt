The total number of data events (points) and the SM expectation (stacked histograms) in all validation regions after the SRA--B, SRC and SRD background-only fit. The stacked histograms show the SM prediction and the hatched uncertainty band around the SM prediction shows the total uncertainty, which include the MC statistical uncertainties, theory-related and detector-related systematic uncertainties. The lower panel shows the significance of the difference between data and the background prediction calculated with the method described in Ref. [120]. The validation regions considered in the SRA--B, SRC and SRD fits are separated by vertical dashed lines.
