Distributions illustrating the agreement between data (points) and the SM expectation (stacked histograms, after simultaneously fitting to all backgrounds) in the antibart control regions: (a) m<sub>T</sub><sup>b,max</sup> for CRTAB, (b) R<sub>ISR</sub> for CRTC, and  E<sub>T</sub><sup>miss</sup>/&radic;H<sub>T</sub> for (c) CRTD1 and (d) CRTD2. The hatched uncertainty band around the SM expectation includes the combination of MC statistical, theory-related and detector-related systematic uncertainties. The rightmost bin in each plot includes all overflows.
