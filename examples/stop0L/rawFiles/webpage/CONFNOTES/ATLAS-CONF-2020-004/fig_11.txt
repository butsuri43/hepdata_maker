Event yields comparing data (points) to the SM prediction (stacked histograms) in all signal regions after the SRA--B, SRC and SRD background-only fits. The hatched uncertainty band around the SM prediction shows the total uncertainty, which includes the MC statistical uncertainties, detector-related systematic uncertainties, and theoretical uncertainties. The signal regions included in the SRA--B, SRC and SRD fits are separated by vertical dashed lines.
