Distributions illustrating the agreement between data (points) and the SM expectation (stacked histograms, after simultaneously fitting to all backgrounds) in several Z+jets  control regions: (a) &Sscr;' and (b) m<sub>T2,&chi;<sup>2</sup></sub> for CRZAB-TTTW, (c) &Delta; R(b<sub>1</sub>,b<sub>2</sub>) for CRZAB-T0, and (d) E<sub>T</sub><sup>miss'</sup>/&radic;H<sub>T</sub> for CRZD0. The hatched uncertainty band around the SM expectation includes the combination of MC statistical, theory-related and detector-related systematic uncertainties. The rightmost bin in each plot includes all overflows.
