Distributions illustrating the agreement between data (points) and the SM expectation (stacked histograms, after simultaneously fitting to all backgrounds) in several W+jets and single top control regions: (a) m<sub>T2,&chi;<sup>2</sup></sub> for CRWAB, E<sub>T</sub><sup>miss</sup>/&radic;H<sub>T</sub> for (b) CRWD0 and (c) CRWD1, and (d) m<sub>T</sub><sup>b,max</sup> for CRSTAB. The hatched uncertainty band around the SM expectation includes the combination of MC statistical, theory-related and detector-related systematic uncertainties. The rightmost bin in each plot includes all overflows.
