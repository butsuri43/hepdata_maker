A summary of the normalisation factors determined from the various background-only fits. The total number of data events (points) and the SM expectation (stacked histograms) are shown in each control region before the fit. The uncertainty associated with the SM expectation includes the combination of MC statistical uncertainties, theory-related and detector-related systematic uncertainties.  The normalisation factor applied to each background source (&mu;<sub>bkg</sub>) after the fit and respective uncertainty, including the combination of MC statistical uncertainties, theory-related and detector-related systematic uncertainties, is shown in the lower panel. The control regions included in the SRA--B, SRC and SRD fits are separated by vertical dashed lines.
