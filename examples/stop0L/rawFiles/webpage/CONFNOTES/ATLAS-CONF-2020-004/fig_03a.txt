A summary of the background control region strategy used in the (a) SRA--B and (b) SRD fits. The orthogonality between the Z+jets (Z), tt&#772;+Z (TTZ), antibart (T), W+jets (W), and single top (ST) backgrounds control regions and the signal and validation regions (SR+VR) included in the SRA--B fit rely on the number of leptons, N<sub>&#8467;</sub>, and the number of b-tagged jets, N<sub>b</sub>. T and ST are made orthogonal by selecting either low (<20 GeV) or high (>27 GeV) p<sub>T</sub> leptons, respectively. The orthogonality between the Z+jets (Z), antibart (T), and W+jets (W) backgrounds control regions and the signal and validation regions (SR+VR) included in the SRD fit relies on N<sub>&#8467;</sub> and the distance between the b-tagged jet (b-tagged track jet in CRWD0) closest to the lepton, &Delta; R(b,&#8467;). The selection applied on the latter (Y<sub>1</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>) varies depending on N<sub>b</sub>. Additional selections not appearing on the sketches ensure orthogonality between the SR and the VR. The extrapolation from CRs to SRs involves extra kinematic quantities not necessarily mentioned on this sketch which are region-specific and detailed in the text.
