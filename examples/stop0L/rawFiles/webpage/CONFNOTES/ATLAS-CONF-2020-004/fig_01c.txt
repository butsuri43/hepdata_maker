Decay topologies of the signal models considered in the analysis: (a) two-body, (b) three-body, (c) four-body top squark decays, the top quarks being produced in pairs, and (d) up-type, third-generation scalar leptoquark pair production, with both leptoquarks decaying to a top quark and a neutralino or a bottom quark and a &tau;-lepton. For simplicity, no distinction is made between particles and antiparticles. Only hadronic W boson decays are shown.
