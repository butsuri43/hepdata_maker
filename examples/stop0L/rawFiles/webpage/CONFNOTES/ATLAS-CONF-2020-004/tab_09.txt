Systematic uncertainties (in percent) greater than 1% for at least one category within SRA and SRB. Uncertainties are expressed relative to the total background estimates and larger uncertainties are shown with higher opacity. The uncertainties due to the scaling of background events based on data in control regions are indicated for each background component by &mu;<sub>antibart</sub>, &mu;<sub>tt&#772;+Z</sub>,  &mu;<sub>Z</sub>, &mu;<sub>W</sub>, and &mu;<sub>single top</sub>. The theory uncertainties quoted for each background include the different shape uncertainties described in the text.
