Distributions of (a) objmetsig in SRA-TW, (b) mantikttwelvezero in SRB-TT, (c) rISR in SRC, and (d--f) htsig  in SRD0--2 after the SRA--B, SRC and SRD background-only likelihood fits. The stacked histograms show the SM prediction and the hatched uncertainty band around the SM prediction shows the total uncertainty, which includes the MC statistical uncertainties, detector-related systematic uncertainties, and theoretical uncertainties. The data (points) are overlaid. For each variable, the distribution for a representative signal hypothesis is overlaid as a dashed line. The rightmost bin includes overflow events.
