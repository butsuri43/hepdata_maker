Observed (red solid line) and expected (black dashed line) limits on up-type, third-generation leptoquarks. (a) Limits as a function of the branching ratio of leptoquarks decaying into b&tau; (with the only other decay allowed being into t&nu;) vs leptoquark mass. (b) Limits on the production cross section at 95 CL as a function of leptoquark mass assuming that all leptoquarks decay into t&nu;. Uncertainty bands corresponding to the &plusmn; 1&sigma; variation of the expected limit (yellow band) and the sensitivity of the observed limit are also indicated. Observed limits from previous searches with the ATLAS detector at &radic;{s}=13~TeV~cite{EXOT-2017-30} are overlaid (a) in grey and (b) as a blue dashed line.
